1. slot booking issue - time mismatch
2.The "Production Fix" (Cron Job)
In a real application, you never manually create slots. You write a Cron Job (a scheduled task) that runs every night at midnight.

Logic: "Every night at 00:00, check if slots exist for Date + 30 days. If not, create them."

2. Transcation problem:
When you install MongoDB locally (using the standard installer or simple Docker command) and run it, 
it starts as a Standalone node. It does not have an "Oplog" (Operations Log) configured,
 which is required to track transaction numbers and ensure data consistency across multiple operations.

-->  Transaction numbers are only allowed on a replica set member or mongos
        1- why i choose replica set for transaction?
        2- how it works ?
        3 - what work it do?
        4- alternate option?
        5 why you choose this?
